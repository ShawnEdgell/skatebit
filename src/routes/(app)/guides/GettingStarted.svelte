<h2>Step 1: Check Your Game Version</h2>
<p>
	Ensure you know your Skater XL version, as mod compatibility varies by version. Check the version
	at launch in the lower-left corner; v1.2.2.8 and v1.2.10.4 are the most common.
</p>
<h2>Step 2: Changing Game Versions (Optional)</h2>
<p>
	To switch versions, right-click Skater XL in Steam, select <b>Properties > Betas,</b> then choose from
	the dropdown.
</p>
<h2>Step 3: Download UnityModManager</h2>
<p>
	Download the UnityModManager application to start installing mods. This tool is essential for
	managing and installing all Skater XL script mods. You will need to log in to Nexus Mods in order
	to download the file.
</p>
<p>
	The latest UnityModManager has been updated to work with any version of Skater XL. Make sure to
	select "Skater XL v1.2.2.8" as your game if you are playing on the Alpha branch.
