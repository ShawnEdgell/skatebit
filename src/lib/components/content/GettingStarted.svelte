	<h2>Getting Started with Skater XL Modding</h2>
	<p>
		This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get you up and running with all the
		latest mods.
	</p>
	<h3>Step 1: Check Your Game Version</h3>
	<p>
		Ensure you know your Skater XL version, as mod compatibility varies by version. Check the
		version at launch in the lower-left corner; v1.2.2.8 and v1.2.10.4 are the most common.
	</p>
	<h3>Step 2: Changing Game Versions (Optional)</h3>
	<p>
		To switch versions, right-click <em>Skater XL</em> in Steam, select Properties &gt; Betas, then choose
		from the dropdown.
	</p>
	<h3>Step 3: Download UnityModManager</h3>

	<h3>Step 4: UnityModManager Setup</h3>
	<p>
		After downloading, unzip the file, open the folder, and run
		<strong>UnityModManager.exe.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are playing on version 1.2.2.8 (Alpha), select 'Skater XL v1.2.2.8' as your game from the
		dropdown menu. If you are playing a different version, simply select 'Skater XL.'
	</p>
	<p>Set the game path to:</p>
	<p>C:\ProgramFiles(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SkaterXL" /></p>
	<p>
		Click <strong>"Install"</strong> or <strong>"Update"</strong> to complete the setup.
	</p>
	<h3>Step 5: Download and Install Mods</h3>
	<p>
		Download mods compatible with your game version and drop them into UnityModManager. Check our
		<a href="/mods">Mods</a> tab for a list of functional mods.
	</p>
	<h3>Step 6: Launch Skater XL</h3>
	<p>
		Start the game! If everything went well, UnityModManager will show up upon launch and all of
		your mods will be listed. Status: green means the mod is working. Status: red means the mod is
		not working and will need to be updated or removed.
